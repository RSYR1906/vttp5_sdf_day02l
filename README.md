#Lecture 2 Notes

Attributes should be mostly private

To retrieve and modify attributes, we use setters and getters

**Structure of a object**

-Class
-Constructor (initializing objects)
-setter and getter
-method

Constructors are used when there is a need for certain values to be in the object


this (keyword) helps to access the class level variable 

**this.cpu=cpu** [using the value of the class level cpu variable and initialise to the local constructor variable cpu]
