#Lecture 2 Notes

Attributes should be mostly private

To retrieve and modify attributes, we use setters and getters

**Structure of a object**

-Class
-Constructor (initializing objects)
-setter and getter
-method

Constructors are used when there is a need for certain values to be in the object

this (keyword) helps to access the class level variable

**this.cpu=cpu** [using the value of the class level cpu variable and initialise to the local constructor variable cpu]

##Encapsulation##

getters and setters methods (for private variables in class)

Help to hide all the hidden details.


##Derived Classes##
Parent child relationship [Define by using keyword **extends**]
Parent class tend to be more generic, child class will be more specific 

Functions overriding [must include @Override above the overriding method and use keyword super to reference parent class method]
